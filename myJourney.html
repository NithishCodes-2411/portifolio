                    Upon the completion of my 10th grade with a commendable CGPA, a critical juncture in my academic journey presented itself: the daunting task of determining the 
                    appropriate stream for my 11th grade.As a fervent admirer of science, I was resolute in my decision to choose the science stream. However, the selection of either PCM 
                    and biology or PCM and computer science proved to be a challenging dilemma. The source of this predicament is one that resonates with many- the family. Although my 
                    initial inclination was to pursue biology with aspirations of becoming a physician, the financial apprehensions voiced by certain relatives prompted a change of course 
                    towards computer science, despite the encouragement of my supportive parents.
                    The initial days of my 11th grade were arduous as I encountered some difficulty in comprehending the foundational principles of computer science. Nonetheless, my CS 
                    instructor proved to be a great ally in my academic pursuit by fostering a genuine understanding of the subject matter rather than superficially glossing over it. 
                    Python served as my inaugural programming language, and in a few months, I grew to appreciate its intricacies. Motivated to delve deeper, I began to explore various
                     topics beyond the curriculum and engaged in small-scale projects. As a result, I successfully completed my final project, a payroll management system, in my 12th grade.
                    In 2021, I triumphantly concluded my 12th grade with exemplary results in all subjects, a moment of jubilation for my family and me. Furthermore, this was a crucial period 
                    in my academic journey as I embarked on the process of selecting a suitable college to further my education. With an acceptable cut-off, I was steadfast in my determination 
                    to major in computer science, and after submitting an application to Dalhousie University, I was offered a place to pursue a Bachelor of Applied Computer Science degree.
